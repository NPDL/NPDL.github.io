								Job Description:
The Neuroplasticity &amp; Development Lab at Johns Hopkins University invites applications for a 2-3 year NIH funded post-doctoral research position (PI: Dr. Marina Bedny).

The Neuroplasticity &amp; Development lab investigates how experience shapes human cognition and brain function using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and behavioral measures. We compare the minds and brains of populations with different development experiences e.g. congenitally blind, late blind and sighted individuals. A key research direction in the lab investigates the reorganization of visual cortex in blindness as a window into understanding the functional flexibility of human cortex. We also investigate the influence of sensory and non-sensory experience on the organization of conceptual systems and experience-based plasticity in higher-cognitive systems.

The post-doctoral fellow will have an opportunity to develop her/his own research program within the themes of the laboratory: plasticity and development of higher-cognitive systems. Fellows will be encouraged to take part in the intellectually rich cognitive science and neuroscience community of Johns Hopkins University.
<br>
<br>
<h5>Job Qualifications</h5>
A Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience, Experimental Psychology or related field is required. Qualified applicants will have a strong interest in cognitive neuroscience, development and neuroplasticity and higher-order cognition. Expertise in fMRI is preferred but candidates with proficiency in other relevant domains/techniques will also be considered (e.g. psycholinguistics, TMS/EEG/DTI).
<br>
<br>
<h5>How to Apply</h5>
Interested candidates should submit a letter of interest, a CV and contact information for three references by emailing the lab director at <a href="mailto:marina.bedny@jhu.edu">marina.bedny@jhu.edu</a>. Additionally, please upload the above application materials to Interfolio https://account.interfolio.com/login. Applications will be evaluated on an ongoing basis until the position is filled. The starting date is flexible and available candidates could begin work immediately. However, we would like to fill the position no later than September 2018.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Graduate Students</h4>
The Neuroplasticity and Development laboratory welcomes applications from students interested in plasticity, development, concepts and language. If you are interested in joining the lab, please <a href="mailto:marina.bedny@jhu.edu">email Dr. Marina Bedny</a>.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Summer Internship Opportunity for Blind and Visually Impaired Students</h4>
The Neuroplasticity and Development laboratory is accepting applications for summer research internship positions for 2019, from blind and visually impaired students who have an interest in cognitive psychology or neuroscience. Previous research experience is not necessary.

To apply, please fill out the <a href="forms/NPDL_Undergrad_RA_Application.docx">application form</a> and email it to us along with your transcript at <a href="mailto:plasticity_lab@jhu.edu?subject=Research%20Assistant%20application">plasticity_lab@jhu.edu</a>.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Research Assistants</h4>
The Neuroplasticity and Development laboratory welcomes applications for volunteer research assistants. Primary responsibilities will include: recruiting and scheduling study participants, testing participants (children and adults), and assisting with behavioral/MRI data analysis.

The ideal candidate will have an interest in cognitive or developmental psychology, be self-motivated, organized and able to work well independently and in groups. Good communication and interpersonal skills are also essential. Programming experience is a plus (especially in MATLAB, Python, or shell scripting). Previous research experience is not necessary.

Research Assistants register for 3 course credits per semester and are required to make a 2-semester commitment. Undergraduate research assistants work in the laboratory at least 10 hours per week and attend weekly lab meetings.

To apply, please fill out the <a href="forms/NPDL_2019_undergradapp.docx">application form</a> and email it to us along with your transcript at <a href="mailto:plasticity_lab@jhu.edu?subject=Research%20Assistant%20application">plasticity_lab@jhu.edu</a>.

						<h3>Faculty</h3>
						<p><a href="http://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/marina-bedny/">Marina Bedny</a></br>
						<a href="pubs/BednyCV_2019_latest.pdf">Marina Bedny CV</a></br>
						410-516-2841</br>

						231 Ames Hall</p>
						<h3>Post-Doctoral Fellows</h3>
						<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/lisamusz/">Lisa Musz</a></br>
						<em>emusz1 at jhu dot edu</em></br>
						Research Interests: How do the things that we see and the things that we talk about influence what we know about the world, and how is this information organized in the brain? I am interested in studying the roles of vision and language in knowledge, and how changes in experience and context can alter neural representations of semantic memory.</p>
						<p>Liz Saccone </br> 
						<em>esaccon2 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research interests: I am interested in how our visual and physical experience with things in the world influence our conceptual understanding of, well, everything! Currently in the lab I am studying blind individuals’ understanding of phenomena that are thought to be primarily visual - like scenes and places.</p>
						<p>Mengyu Tian </br> 
						<em>mengyutian at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests: I am interested in how the brain represents different writing systems, such as English vs. Chinese or Braille vs. Sighted reading. I am also interested in how sensory loss shapes neural circuits, using functional and structural MRI.</p>
						<h3>Graduate Students</h3> 
						<p>Yun-Fei Liu </br> 
						<em>yliu291 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests: I’m interested in the neural basis of all kinds of reading, be it normal reading, Braille reading, or even code reading. You can say what I’m doing is some kind of rudimentary mind reading—with a super bulky MRI scanner!</p>
						<h3>Lab Manager</h3>
						<p>Brianna Aheimer</br> 
						<em>baheime1 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests:  I’m interested in the roles that nature and nurture play in shaping human cognition and behavior. I’m also curious about the underlying neural mechanisms involved in these developments.</p>
						<h3>Undergraduate Research Assistants</h3>
						<p>Rhys Gough</br> 
						<em>rgough5 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests:  I'm interested in how our sensations contribute to the building of abstract concepts. I'm also interested in changes to neural circuitry after trauma.</p>
						<p>Grace Lee</br> 
						<em>ylee192 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests: I'm interested in how experience affects brain development and shapes the mind. I'm also interested in how the reorganization of the brain and the mind are correlated.</p>
						<p>Carol Lu</br> 
						<em>clu33 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests:  I am interested in studying cognition from both the neurological and psychological perspectives. In particular, I am interested in the effects of experience on cognition.</p>
						<p>Zaida McClinton</br> 
						<em>zmcclin1 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests: I’m interested in neuroplasticity and the brain's ability to enhance itself and adapt to a variety of stimuli. I am also interested in understanding exactly how experiences are received, processed, and stored by the brain.</p>
						<p>Veronica Montane</br> 
						<em>vmontan2 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests:  I am interested in the brain and how different experiences help shape the brain. I'm also interested in cognition and how knowledge is affected by experience.</p>

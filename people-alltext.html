						<h3>Faculty</h3>
						<p><a href="https://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/marina-bedny/">Marina Bedny</a></br>
						<a href="pubs/BednyCV_2019_latest.pdf">Marina Bedny CV</a></br>

						<h3>Post-Doctoral Fellows</h3>
						<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/lisamusz/">Lisa Musz</a></br>
						<em>emusz1 at jhu dot edu</em></br>
						Research Interests: How do the things that we see and the things that we talk about influence what we know about the world, and how is this information organized in the brain? I am interested in studying the roles of vision and language in knowledge, and how changes in experience and context can alter neural representations of semantic memory.</p>
						<p>Liz Saccone </br> 
						<em>esaccon2 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research interests: I am interested in how our visual and physical experience with things in the world influence our conceptual understanding of, well, everything! Currently in the lab I am studying blind individuals’ understanding of phenomena that are thought to be primarily visual - like scenes and places.</p>
						<p>Mengyu Tian </br> 
						<em>mengyutian at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests: I am interested in how the brain represents different writing systems, such as English vs. Chinese or Braille vs. Sighted reading. I am also interested in how sensory loss shapes neural circuits, using functional and structural MRI.</p>
						<h3>Graduate Students</h3> 
						<p>Yun-Fei Liu </br> 
						<em>yliu291 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests: I’m interested in the neural basis of all kinds of reading, be it normal reading, Braille reading, or even code reading. You can say what I’m doing is some kind of rudimentary mind reading—with a super bulky MRI scanner!</p>
						<p>Miriam Hauptman</br> 
						<em>mhauptm1 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests: My work investigates the distinct influences of sensory and cultural experience on the neural basis of language.</p>
						<p>Akshi</br>
						<em>alnu1 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
							</p>
						<p>Ziwen Wang</br>
						Research Interests: I am interested in how the brain supports language and logical reasoning , and how developmental experience shapes these processes.

						<h3>Lab Manager</h3>
						<p>Ziqi Chen</br>
						<em>zchen140 at jhu dot edu</em></br>
						Research Interests: I’m interested in how mechanisms that support language and sound come to be shaped by sensory and environmental influences.</p>
						<h3>Undergraduate Research Assistants</h3>
						<p>Zaida McClinton</br> 
						<em>zmcclin1 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests: I’m interested in neuroplasticity and the brain's ability to enhance itself and adapt to a variety of stimuli. I am also interested in understanding exactly how experiences are received, processed, and stored by the brain.</p>
						<p>Laila Paredes</br> 
						<em>lparede2 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests:  Research Interests: I am interested in the brain's neuro-flexibility and interconnectivity between brain areas. I am also interested in how we can computationally understand our findings.</p>
						<p>Clarissa Alfonso</br>
						<em>calfons5 at jhu dot edu</em></br> 
						Research Interests: I’m interested in the neural basis of logical reasoning and how it compares across individuals with developmental differences. I want to learn more about how the brain rewires itself in response to everything we experience (or don’t experience!) and how those changes affect our behavior.</p>
